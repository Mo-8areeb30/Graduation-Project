Abstract:
In order to manage inventory, optimise operations, and make wise business decisions, the retail sector
must be a dynamic and competitive industry. I give a thorough investigation of retail sales forecasting
utilising cutting-edge machine learning methods in this thesis, concentrating on the use of Prophet
and XGBoost models. The objective of this study is to create reliable forecasting models that can help
merchants forecast future sales and enhance their overall performance. There are various important
steps in the research methodology. To assure data quality and consistency, a dataset from a wellknown retail company, Rossman, is first gathered and preprocessed. Handling null values, missing
values, duplicates, and outliers is a part of the preprocessing process. Feature extraction is also done
to identify patterns and trends in the data that are pertinent. To obtain understanding of the dataset,
exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used to find trends, seasonalities, anomalies, and patterns that
might direct the modelling process. Future sales are predicted using the Prophet model, a time series
forecasting algorithm created by Facebook. The algorithm creates forecasts for a given time horizon
after being trained on historical sales data. Metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared
Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to assess the performance of the model.
The obtained MAE, MSE, and RMSE values provide as evidence of Prophet's ability in properly
forecasting retail sales, according to the results. To further improve the forecasts' accuracy, the
XGBoost model, a potent gradient boosting algorithm, is used. On the preprocessed dataset, the
XGBoost model is trained taking into account store attributes, promotions, and historical sales data.
Prophet and XGBoost can be directly compared because both models' performances are assessed
using the same metrics. By achieving lower MAE, MSE, and RMSE values than Prophet, the results
show that XGBoost outperforms Prophet in terms of forecasting accuracy. A thorough testing process
is used to verify the models' dependability and generalizability. The dataset is divided into training and
testing sets, with Prophet receiving a 70/30 split and XGBoost receiving a 90/10 split. The models are
tested with data that hasn't been seen before after being trained on the training data. The testing
outcomes show that both models are reliable and effectively generalise to new situations.
Additionally, visualisations are used to improve the interpretation and comprehension of the
predictions made by the models. The projected values and the actual values are displayed in plots so
that the accuracy of the models may be evaluated visually. Retailers may make decisions more easily
by using these visualisations, which give them an intuitive representation of the performance of the
models. By offering a thorough examination of the use of the Prophet and XGBoost models[5], this
thesis makes a contribution to the subject of retail sales forecasting. The study methodology offers a
comprehensive approach to estimating retail sales by incorporating data collection, preprocessing,
EDA, modelling, assessment, and visualisation. The results demonstrate the potential of cutting-edge
machine learning methods to enhance retail performance and offer helpful advice for merchants
looking for precise sales forecasts. The findings open the door for further investigation into the
creation of reliable forecasting models and their incorporation into real-world retail applications.
